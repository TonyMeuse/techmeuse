    <p class="date">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Split Monkey is developed by Anthony Meuse. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how Split Monkey handles your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Split Monkey does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All information you enter into the app — including group names, people, expenses, and settlements — is stored locally on your device only.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Split Monkey does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external service used is Apple's In-App Purchase system for the optional Pro upgrade, which is handled entirely by Apple under their own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is saved locally on your device. If you delete the app, all data is permanently removed. We have no access to your data at any time.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Split Monkey does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
